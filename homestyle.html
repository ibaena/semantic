<h2>Mace Windu</h2>
<article>Mace Windu was a male Korun Human Jedi Master of legendary status who was the Master of the Order in the days leading up to the Battle of Geonosis, after which he gave the title to Grand Master Yoda. Hailing from the world of Haruun Kal, Mace Windu served as one of the last members of the Jedi High Council before the Great Jedi Purge. Serving on the Council, Windu was often regarded as second only to the Grand Master Yoda, though Windu was eight centuries Yoda's junior. Windu's wisdom and power were considered legendary by many, as were the weight of his words. Widely considered one of the best swordsmen in the Jedi Order, Windu created Vaapad, the modern seventh form of lightsaber combat which he mastered. He was the only practitioner of the form who did not fall to the dark side. Windu served the Jedi Order his entire life, training several Jedi, including Depa Billaba and Echuu Shen-Jon.</article>

<h2>Julius Winnfield</h2>
<article>Whether he was working for gang boss Marsellus Wallace or not, for years one thing that gangster Jules Winnfield openly recited was a version of the Biblical chapter Ezekiel 25:17 to his victims before he killed them. One day, a job for Wallace goes awry when his employees Winnfield and Vincent Vega go to recover a briefcase that was stolen from Wallace. Winnfield and Vega dispatch Wallace's ex-partners with gunplay and ease. When their work seems complete, an extra man who was hiding in a spare room in the apartment attacks the hitmen by surprise, shooting at them with his .357 handgun. None of the extra man's shots hit their targets. Jules and Vincent shoot the extra man dead.
